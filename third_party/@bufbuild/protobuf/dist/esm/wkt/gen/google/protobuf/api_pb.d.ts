 *         option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/{resource=**}";

 *
 *     apis:
 *     - name: google.storage.v2.Storage
 *       mixins:
 *       - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl
 *
 * The mixin construct implies that all methods in `AccessControl` are
 * also declared with same name and request/response types in
 * `Storage`. A documentation generator or annotation processor will
 * see the effective `Storage.GetAcl` method after inherting
 * documentation and annotations as follows:
 *
 *     service Storage {

 *
 * Note how the version in the path pattern changed from `v1` to `v2`.
 *
 * If the `root` field in the mixin is specified, it should be a
